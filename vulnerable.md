What is meant by “Individuals with Pre-Existing Condition” or “Vulnerable groups”? 

Not all people with disabilities will fall into the category of “vulnerable groups”. And not everyone in this category will self-identify as disabled. “Vulnerable groups” refers to people who are more susceptible to the coronavirus and Covid-19. This group includes those who are:
* Aged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions)
* Less than 70 with an underlying health condition listed below (i.e. anyone instructed to get a flu shot as an adult each year on medical grounds)
* Chronic (long-term) respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema or bronchitis.
* Chronic heart disease, such as heart failure
* Chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis
* Chronic kidney disease
* Chronic neurological conditions, (i.e. such as Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), a learning disability or cerebral palsy)
* Diabetes
* Problems with your spleen, (i.e. if you've had sickle cell disease or had your spleen replaced)
* Being seriously overweight (a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above)
* Those who are pregnant
