Businesses are changing how their services are offered—from pharmacies to grocery stores. This page provides a directory of business with specific services for people with disabilities.

**👉 There is no cost to be listed on the site or to access the site. And there never will be. 👈**

What you will need:
✅ Your Name
✅ Your Business Email
✅ A 100-word description of how you are responding to the needs of people with disabilities during COVID. Not just a general company profile.
✅ The link directly to the specific page on your website where people can get more information.
✅ Your company logo (.png or .jpg).
