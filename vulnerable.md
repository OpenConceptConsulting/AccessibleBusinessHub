Businesses are changing how their services are offered—from pharmacies to grocery stores. This page provides a directory of business with specific services for people with disabilities.

There is no cost to be listed on the site or to access the site. And there never will be.

How to get your business listed... [CLICK HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSejm5ZIHrn6IIcvWNifnCeHyQnGI5yVBJNoFc_MGgaCVHvFYA/viewform)

What you will need:
* Your company logo (.png or .jpg).
* A 100-word description of how you are responding to the needs of people with disabilities during COVID. Not just a general company profile.
* The link directly to the specific page on your website where people can get more information.
