Businesses are changing how their services are offeredâ€”from pharmacies to grocery stores. This page provides a directory of business with specific services for people with disabilities.

**ðŸ‘‰ There is no cost to be listed on the site or to access the site. And there never will be. ðŸ‘ˆ**


How to get your business listed...


What we require:

âœ… Your Name

âœ… Your Business Email

âœ… A 100-word description of how you are responding to the needs of people with disabilities during COVID. Not just a general company profile.

âœ… The link directly to the specific page on your website where people can get more information.

âœ… Your company logo (.png or .jpg).
