The virus and physical distancing may affect people with disabilities differently than the rest of the Canadian population.

Physical distancing and the risk that a caregiver gets sick is a dangerous situation for many people with disabilities. Additionally, people with disabilities may be more physically vulnerable and face [higher exposure risks](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#r).

For individuals living with a disability and their supports, please know that resources and support are available. Please take the necessary time to think through your situation and various scenarios. Plan ahead for situations and how you would manage.
