We want to offer some advice on how the virus may affect disabled people. This advice is specifically about the coronavirus and your disabled employees.</p>

<p>Isolation is a dangerous situation for people with disabilities thatthey rely on common everyday people to live.

<p>We can do this together by following the direction of our public health experts and government officials to collectively address the global pandemic. Normal life will return, just as soon as it‚Äôs safe to do so.
I‚Äôm proud of how the Canadians have rallied to respond to this unprecedented challenge. In a short period of time under difficult and rapidly changing circumstances.
Our hearts and thoughts go out to the people who have been affected by this unpresented event and we appreciate the healthcare workers, local communities and governments around the world who are on the front line working to contain this pandemic.
In closing, we want to thank you, our fellow Canadians, government authorities and the members of our health services. Our country has never before been faced with such a challenge however our spirit of community and commitment has never been stronger. Please take care of yourselves and one another.
