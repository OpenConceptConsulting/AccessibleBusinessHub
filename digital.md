## Working in an Inclusive Digital World
As we are all being required to respect physical distancing, it means that many of us are relying on digital tools in an unprecedented way. This provides greater social connection for some, but at the same time excludes others. When implementing digital solutions, it is imperative to be inclusive of those who may have disabilities. Remember that many disabilities are invisible, particularly for those with hearing or sight impairments.

### Video Captioning
Since we are using more online tools like video conferencing, live streaming and webcasting to have conversations and meetings, here are a few resources which can be used to provide captions for those with hearing impairments or who are trying to work in a noisy environment.
