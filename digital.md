## Working in an Inclusive Digital World
As we are all being required to respect physical distancing, it means that many of us are relying on digital tools in an unprecedented way. This provides greater social connection for some, but at the same time excludes others. When implementing digital solutions, it is imperative to be inclusive of those who may have disabilities. Remember that many disabilities are invisible, particularly for those with hearing or sight impairments.

When creating digital content it is important to remember that [we all have a role](https://accessibility-for-teams.com/). Authors, designers, and developers all have a role in ensuring that ideas can be understood by the user. Digital tools are designed to be interactive, so special attention needs to be placed in ensuring that people using assistive technology can access them. We must also remember that very few of us are working in ideal conditions, particularly as we struggle to blance home/life responsibilities. 

There are mroe organiztions releasing what they have tried. Drake Music in the UK put together this list of suggestions for [Accessibility in Video Conferencing and Remote Meetings](https://www.drakemusic.org/blog/becky-morris-knight/accessibility-in-video-conferencing-and-remote-meetings/).
