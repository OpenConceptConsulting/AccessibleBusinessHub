The **Accessible Business Hub** is here to help people with disabilities and employers to adapt to life amidst COVID-19. 

From employment law to getting groceries, the Accessible Business Hub will provide up-to-date information for Canadians with disabilities as we navigate the current pandemic reality. Developed by people with disabilities for people with disabilities, the site will provide key information at peopleâ€™s fingertips. 

Physical distancing is forcing us to change how we communicate and interact with one another in our personal and professional lives. Equally, we now need help from the business community to know that they understand, and are making changes, to keep us safe as employees, clients and customers.

**Planning Ahead**

The virus and physical distancing may affect people with disabilities differently than the rest of the Canadian population.

Physical distancing and the risk that a caregiver gets sick is a dangerous situation for many people with disabilities. Additionally, people with disabilities may be more physically vulnerable and face higher exposure risks.

For individuals living with a disability and their supports, please know that resources and support are available. Please take the necessary time to think through your situation and various scenarios. Plan ahead for situations and how you would manage.

Preparedness tips include the following.

**General**
* Keep up to date on the situation. This can include following your local health authority on social media or checking their website.

**Attendant Care**
* Have conversations with your support team about the backup plan if your main caregiver becomes sick or is reassigned.
* Have a back-up plan if your attendant does not come to work or is sick.
* Ensure attendants have not travelled to an affected area or outside of Canada in the last 14 days.
* Ask attendants to wash their hands when they arrive and before they provide any assistance.
* Put hand sanitizer or disinfecting wipes at the main entrance to your home with a garbage pail for any refuse.
* Be sure your attendants wash their hands after all assistance.
* Be sure that you wash your hands after all assistance.

**For Caregivers and Attendants**
* Before visiting please call to inform the individual you are dropping by.
* Be ready to answer any questions about your recent engagement with other individuals to see the likelihood of passing on the disease.

**Groceries and essentials**
* Create a buddy system to make sure you get groceries, equipment and other necessities if local public transit systems temporarily close.


**Medication**
