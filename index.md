## The Business of Accessibility

The **Accessible Business Hub** is here to aggregate ideas, tools and practices that allow people with disabilities to adapt and organize to the new realities of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The world has changed for everyone, forever and this Hub will be a portal to information and resources which are aimed at supporting people with disabilities in Canada.

You can learn [about us](/AboutUs.html) and what inspired us to set up this hub. We have collected what we see as critical information about [what you need to know](/WhatYouNeed2Know.html) as a person with disabilities. As part of the social distancing that we are all needing to do, we living digitally more, here are some resources support [digital inclusion](/WorkingDigitally.html).
