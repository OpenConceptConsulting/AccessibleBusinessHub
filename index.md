The **Accessible Business Hub** is here to help people with disabilities and employers to adapt to life amidst COVID-19. 

From employment law to getting groceries, the Accessible Business Hub will provide up-to-date information for Canadians with disabilities as we navigate the current pandemic reality. Developed by people with disabilities for people with disabilities, the site will provide key information at peopleâ€™s fingertips. 

Physical distancing is forcing us to change how we communicate and interact with one another in our personal and professional lives. We need the business community to respond and make changes to keep us safe as employees, clients and customers.
