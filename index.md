# Welcome ot the Accessible Business:Hub

These pages are here to aggregate ideas, tools and practices that allow people with disabilities to adapt and organize to the new realities of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which has fundimentally changed our our society in the last few weeks.

You can learn [about us](/AboutUs.html) and what inspired us to set up this hub. We have collected what we see as critical information about [what you need to know](/WhatYouNeed2Know.html) as a person with disabilities.
