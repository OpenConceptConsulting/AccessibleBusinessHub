<p>This information has been assembled to assist you to organize yourself during the Covid-19 pandemic:
We want to offer some advice on how the virus may affect disabled people. This advice is specifically about the coronavirus and your disabled employees.</p>

<p>Isolation is a dangerous situation for people with disabilities thatthey rely on common everyday people to live. It is for the reason that a group of individuals have created this Accessible Business Hub. The information that you can locate on the site is to assist Canadians with disabilities and Business on what is available.</p>

<p>We can do this together by following the direction of our public health experts and government officials to collectively address the global pandemic. Normal life will return, just as soon as it’s safe to do so.
I’m proud of how the Canadians have rallied to respond to this unprecedented challenge. In a short period of time under difficult and rapidly changing circumstances.
Our hearts and thoughts go out to the people who have been affected by this unpresented event and we appreciate the healthcare workers, local communities and governments around the world who are on the front line working to contain this pandemic.
In closing, we want to thank you, our fellow Canadians, government authorities and the members of our health services. Our country has never before been faced with such a challenge however our spirit of community and commitment has never been stronger. Please take care of yourselves and one another. 
For individuals with living with a disability: Do not panic. Resources and support is available. Take the necessary time to think through your situation and ask yourself “if” this happens how you would manage it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check the advice from your local provincial health authorities every 24-48 hours.</li>
  <li>If you are person with a disability, have conversations on having a backup plans if your main caregiver becomes sick or is pulled away.</li>
  <li>Have a back-up plan if your attendant does not come to work or is sick: Create a buddy system that can assist you in receiving the necessary groceries or necessary equipment if local public transportation systems temporarily close.</li>
  <li>Keep 30 days of medical supplies (catheters and dressing supplies) and medication on hand.
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure your list of drugs is up-to-date.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Purchase additional batteries for your equipment. Make sure your primary and back up batteries are always charged.</li>
  <li>Make sure all of your medicines can sustain you for the next 90 days. For individuals with regular weekly needs, stay in contact with your pharmacy and physician.</li>
  <li>Ensure attendants have not travelled to an affected area or outside of Canada in the last 14 days.</li>
  <li>Ask attendants to wash their hands when they arrive and before they provide any assistance. Have at the your main entrance a table with hand sanitizer and garbage pall</li>
  <li>Be sure your attendants and you wash your hands after all assistance.</li>
  <li>Prepare your Emergency Go Bag:
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure all your financial and medical information is in the bag you have ready in case you need to be relocated to a medical facility or community centre.</li>
      <li>List of the local phone numbers in case of emergency. Include key people to inform them of your change of circumstances. Have set up on your smart phone emergency texting group</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Before visiting please call to inform the individual, you are dropping by. Be ready to answer some questions about your recent engagement with other individuals to see the likelihood of you passing on the disease.</li>
