## The Ways the Coronavirus has Changed Our Workplace for the Better

Canadian Business and Governments are making massive changes due to coronavirus, some of them should be temporary, but some of the changes should be permanent.

1.	Working from Home
Just last month many individuals could not work remotely, are now doing so from home. Now there is a debate on what can be done remotely and what needs to be done on-site. Canadian companies and governments should take note of the new Accessibility Canada Act (ACA) which requests for reasonable accommodations in the workplace. Working from home can be reasonable for reasonable accommodations. Working form can be a reasonable accommodation, and businesses will have a hard time arguing that working in the office is always required when it’s not required right now.

Working at home can impact businesses for years to come. Many organizations will have to learn that they can operate just fine with most people working remotely. And, in some cases, will come to discover that things really do work better when they are not in the office. Let’s use this as an opportunity to hire disabled people to create ongoing remote-work policies that extend beyond this current crisis.

2. Medical
Employers and employees do not want to catch coronavirus (or anything nasty kicking around) when visiting the doctor’s office. Do not be surprised when, instead of sitting in a doctor’s office waiting room for two hours, you stay at work, and the receptionists call you and say, “the doctor will see you now.”
