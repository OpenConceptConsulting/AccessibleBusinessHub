## Ways the Coronavirus May Have Changed Our Workplace for the Better

Canadian Business and Governments are making massive changes due to he coronavirus threat. Some of these changes will be temporary, while others will have a deeper effect. We will not know until the virus passes and we are back to the new normal.

1.	Working from Home

Less than a month ago, working remotley was not possible for many employees. Now there is a debate on what can be done remotely and what needs to be done on-site. Canadian companies and governments should take note of the new Accessibility Canada Act (ACA) which requests for reasonable accommodations in the workplace. Working from home can be a reasonable solution for reasonable accommodations. And companies will now have a harder time arguing that working in the office is always required when it’s not required right now.

Working at home can impact businesses for years to come. Many organizations will have to learn that they can operate just fine with most people working remotely. And, in some cases, will come to discover that things really do work better when they are not in the office. Let’s use this as an opportunity to hire disabled people to create ongoing remote-work policies that extend beyond this current crisis.

2. Medical Needs

Employers and employees do not want to catch a virus, germ or bacteria when visiting the doctor’s office. Do not be surprised when, instead of sitting in a doctor’s office waiting room for two hours, you stay at work and the receptionist calls you to say, “the doctor will see you now.”
